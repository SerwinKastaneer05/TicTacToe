HTML/Bootstrap: Here is where i created the main page. I created buttons for each cells and named in the . I set up everything nicely in the body to later on design in css and add functions in script.

CSS Desing the whole page. Add some life to the page by changing the cells colors add backround behind the player and computer's name and the restart button.

Javascript/jQuery Here is where all the functions for the game is, I first start by defining the variables and add a comment what each will do. then i went on and add the functions to play the game. I used a lot of if/while loop. i used 2D array to check the winning condition.
